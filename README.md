# New Script #


	Starter for new Python Scripts


## Background ##

	For many of my python scripts, I utilize ArgParse and Logging. I was tired of rewriting the same starter code, so here it is.
	
	ArgParse was preferred as most environments we could control added arguments in a programatic way and for quick CLI testing
	<TODO> add config file feature

	Logging levels is ideal when using a logging aggregation platform, such as the ELK Stack, Splunk, or AWS CloudWatch.
